**Bolded questions will be answered in the Canvas quiz (*Lab 2: Visualizing & Summarizing Numerical Variables*) AS A GROUP. I will ask for group member names on the quiz.**

**Your group only needs to submit ONE final pdf/html lab write up to canvas (*Lab 2: Completion*).**

### Learning outcomes

+ Identify and create appropriate summary statistics and plots given a data set or research question for data.

+ Interpret the following summary statistics in context: median, lower quartile, upper quartile, standard deviation, interquartile range.

+ Given a plot or set of plots, describe and compare the distribution(s) of a single quantitative variable (center, variability, shape, outliers).
  
+ Use `R` to create graphs of variables.

### The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)

These data are on a subset of institutions that met the following selection criteria:

+	Degree granting 

+ United States only

+ Title IV participating

+ Not for profit

+ 2-year or 4-year or above

+ Has full-time first-time undergraduates

*Note:* Several variables have missing values for some institutions (denoted by “NA”).

### Loading in the Data

Run the code chunk below to load the original data set into R. Then look in the Environment in the top right for the data set. Click on it to see the data set in a new tab.

```{r data, include = TRUE}

# We assigned our data set to be called "IPEDS"

IPEDS <- read_csv("data/IPEDS_Data_2018.csv")
```

For our analysis, we will look at the retention rates for *only* the 4-year institutions. In the code below I'm filtering the dataset down to ony include 4-year institutions (eliminating 2-year institutions) and calling this smaller data set (called a subset), `IPEDS_fouryear`. This is the data set you will use for the rest of the lab.

Run the code chunk below to create the subset. You should now see the new subset in your Environment to the right.

```{r data-filter}

# We just created a "smaller" data set from our original data set and called this new one "IPEDS_fouryear".

IPEDS_fouryear <- IPEDS %>%
  filter(Sector != "Public 2-year", 
         Sector != "Private 2-year")
```

### Summarizing Retention Rates

There is a great function from the **mosaic** package called `favstats()`. This function takes one or two variables and outputs the favorite statistics we are interested in! 

The notation for the function is: 

`favstats(variable1 ~ variable2, data = dataset_name)`

In this case we are only interested in *one* variable, so we leave out variable1 from the code line above. But! We need to keep the ~ in the notation. So, the code looks like the following:

```{r summarize}
favstats(~ Retention, data = IPEDS_fouryear) 
```


3.  **Report the value for third quartile and interpret this value in context of the study.**

4.  **What is the interquartile range of the retention rates?**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



5. Report and interpret the value of the standard deviation.

6.  **How many missing values (labeled NA in the data set) are there? Is this concerning?**

### Visualizing Retention Rates

#### Creating a Boxplot 

We will start by creating a boxplot of the retention rates for the 4-year institutions. You will get used to seeing the layout of the ggplot() code we will use to make visualizations, but since this is the first time you are seeing it I'm going to walk you through what the parts mean. 

The first line of code uses the ggplot() function to make a blank plot. Really, the plot doesn't have anything on it! What the function does is (1) specify where the data is coming from, and (2) specify what variables should be put
where. 

The next line tells ggplot() what to put on the blank plot. We get a boxplot by using the geom_boxplot() function, it is as simple as that! 

The final line of code creates nicer axis labels. The default axis labels use the name of the variables in the dataset, which sometimes aren't quite what we want. Using the labs() function, we can specify what labels we want on our plot. 

7. Fill in the code below with (1) the name of the variable you want to plot, and (2) a nice x-axis label to use. *You are replacing the blank spaces in the code chunk.*

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data = IPEDS, 
       mapping = aes(x = ____)
       ) +   
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "_____") 
```

7.  How would you describe the shape of the distribution of retention rates?  
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



8.  Are there outliers present in the dataset? Describe where these outliers are
located. 
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->



#### Creating a Histogram

Next, let's see how our impression of the distribution changes when we visualize it with a histogram. 

The code for a histogram is **very** similar to a boxplot. Really, all we need to change is the line saying to plot a boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`. For a histogram, we use `geom_histogram()`. 

Fill in the code below with (1) the name of the variable you want to plot, and (2) a nice x-axis label to use. *You are replacing the blank spaces in the code chunk.*

```{r histogram}
ggplot(data = IPEDS, 
       mapping = aes(x = ____)
       ) +   
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  labs(x = "_____", 
       y = "Frequency") 
```


#### Robust Statistics

Let's examine how the presence of outliers affect the values of center and spread. 

9.  **Report the two measures of center for retention given in the previous output from the favstats() function).**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->


10.  **Report the two measures of spread for retention given in the previous output (from the favstats() function).**
<!-- Your answer goes below this comment! -->


To show the effect of outliers on the measures of center and spread, in the code below, I increase the smallest values of retention rate in the data by 30%. (AKA observational units with a 0% retention rate in the original data set now have a 30% retention rate in the adjusted data set called `IPEDS_fouryear_adj`).

Run the code chunk below to create an adjusted retention rate data set. You should now see the adjusted retention rate data set in your Environment to the right.

```{r data-adjust}
IPEDS_fouryear_adj <- IPEDS_fouryear %>% 
  mutate(Retention = if_else(Retention == 0, 30, Retention), 
         Retention = as.numeric(Retention)
         )
```

Fill in the code below with the name of the variable you want to obtain summaries for. Note we are now using the adjusted retention rates data set. *You are replacing the blank spaces in the code chunk.*

```{r new-summaries}
favstats(~ ______, data = IPEDS_fouryear_adj) 
```
